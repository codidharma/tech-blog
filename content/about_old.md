I am an integration developer and architect by profession. I have worked as an integration developer, designer architect for better part of 9 years. A recent dash with blazor framework sparked my interest in full stack development.  Over the years I have written many articles on Mircrosoft's technet wiki and have done public presentations around Microsoft Integration tech stack.
