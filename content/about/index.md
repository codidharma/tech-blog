I have been programming, designing and architecting applications for over a decade. I specialize in architecting highly scalable distributed systems and in low code - no code applications. I love to share my knowledge with others to help them get to their goals faster.Over the years I have written many articles on Mircrosoft's technet wiki and have done public presentations for community events and meetups.
